Over the past two months, I have tried exploring the area of distributed systems but I've faced a big hurdle of the lack of a systematic guide of resources. From my seniors at college and blog posts online, the resources and "way to go" that I have heard is to either read textbooks or swarm through research papers. I've found textbooks to be similar to academic learning which is something I want to avoid and research papers do not really describe the terms they are using (which is fair, they probably do so to avoid plagarism) and simply point to earlier work which explains the core concepts they are talking about. So I thought I'd write as I learn and create a resource of my own for distributed systems. I'll be posting unfinished articles as well just so that I can keep myself accountable on a per-commit basis.
